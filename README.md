# Hollywood dashboard

This is a boilerplate for an interface that consists of multiple sections that can be expanded and contracted based on the seleced section. It is not designed to be universal/configurable. But it is coded in a way that adding or modifying layouts should be rather simple. You can specify the dimensions of the sections based on percentages, of based on pixels. You'll have to specify that with the unit property (see `types/dashboard.ts` file for details)
